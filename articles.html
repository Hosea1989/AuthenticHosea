        <p>On January 29th, following a 13 year hiatus, Japanese developer Square Enix released the highly anticipated "Kingdom Hearts III" worldwide for Playstation 4 and Xbox One platforms to complete the popular trilogy.</p>

        <p>The development of Kingdom Hearts III left many fans wondering if they'd ever see the title released in their lifetime. Square Enix ran into many speed humps when they tried to run Kingdom Hearts 3 on their now outdated Luminous Engine (which was used to power another Square Enix title Final Fantasy XV). According to the Kingdom Hearts Director; Tetsuya Nomura, "Due to the impact of changing the game engine to Unreal Engine 4 and with the full support of Epic Games, we'll be able to progress the game smoothly". With Square Enix using Unreal Engine 4 in the development of Kingdom Hearts III, they were able to do things they weren't able to do with the Luminous Engine such as vivid colors, shadows and image rendering. Although changing the game engine did slow down the development of Kingdom Hearts III, it wasn't the only hurdle. According to Lead facial animator, Kayoko Yajima, "Disney wanted their characters to be showing less teeth,' or 'their eyelids needed to move more differently".  In other words, they wanted to preserve the soul and authenticity of the beloved characters.</p>

        <p>Kingdom Hearts is a Japanese Role Playing game (JRPG) about a 14-year-old boy named Sora. The initial story line focuses on the day Sora's home, Destiny Island, was attacked by a dark entity called "The Heartless". After Sora's friends go missing, he is chosen by a magical Keyblade to rescue his friends and defeat the Heartless. Having to leave the island, Sora is joined by two iconic  Disney characters, Donald Duck and Goofy to travel to distant worlds.</p>

        <p>In the Kingdom Hearts series, characters from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series have crossed over into worlds created by Disney. Every Kingdom Hearts game in the series contains different worlds and characters from 50 years of Disney history. In Kingdom Hearts I and II, Disney worlds like Pride Lands from The Lion King or Agrabah from Aladdin have been styled specifically for Kingdom Hearts. In Kingdom Hearts III however the worlds were built completely different.  Square Enix used computer generated (CG) film pieces to create the exact worlds from the beloved Disney films.</p>

        <p>Before the whole Kingdom Hearts projects, Disney had other ideas for videos games. At the time Buena Vista (also known as Disney Interactive Studios) was developing unprofitable educational games. It was later decided that Buena Vista would stop developing Disney games and instead would licenselicense out Disney properties to other developers. After many of the licensees were only producing low-quality games for quick profit, Square Enix pitched an idea that was far outside of  Disney's comfort zone. The developer wanted to produce a game that didn't just focus on one particular movie but a plethora of Disney Intellectual Properties (IPs) that would later evolve into something memorable and long-lasting.</p>

        <p>Although newcomers to the series might have a hard time understanding the storyline, Square Enix has provided a way to make Kingdom Heart III  more appealing to fans and none-fans alike by including a brief recap of The Kingdom Hearts Trilogy thus far.</p>

        <p>It's been a long wait and Kingdom Heart III's story holds true to its counterparts.</p>

        <p>"Kingdom Hearts III"  can be downloaded digitally or purchased physically at a retail price of $59.99 for the Playstation 4 and Xbox One platforms.</p>
